6. go over project instructions - verify everything is implemented
6.3. BUG - no valid board verfication when starting new game -> added kings verification. need to add verification for set
6.10. IMPROVEMENT - set button should disappear on game start since it's disabled
6.15. BUG - EMPTY button is misslocated/ugly
6.18. MINOR BUG - Load a game (can use default), choose PvP, by default the highlighted starting player is Black, even though when starting the first player is the white one (as it should).
6.19. LEAK - libxml2 leak when loading, could not find reason. only single object is leaking. consider ignoring it. there are leaks on SDL that can probably be ginored as well.
6.97. resolve/remove all TODOs in the code
6.98. fix all compilation warnings
6.99. remove debug prints
